# Arduino-Volca-Sync-Clock
Outputs trigger voltage to trigger the sync-in on a volca or pocket operator.

The "clock" has been invented by myself.
There could be a better way, but timing seems to be good enough.

It uses a seven segment display to show information such as main bpm, has LEDs to visualize trigger outputs and uses a rotary encoder to change speed and custom output speeds.
